# riffdump
A cli-tool for inspecting content &amp; metadata of files following the RIFF container format. 

**Disclaimer:** This software is part of a larger project I've been working on in my free time. I threw it together on short notice and I intend to patch additional functionality as time goes on. My experience with the C programming language is very limited and this software is mostly intended to be a fun and rewarding programming exercise. If you intend to use this software, please do so with caution. It's ~~probably~~ *likely* terribly written and you should keep that in mind.
